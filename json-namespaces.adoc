== Introduction
While working in the _Open Canvas Working Group_ footnote:[A workgroup with the goal of creating an interop format for "canvas" tools] I was introduced by members of the _glTF_ working group to their current mechanism for managing extensions in a JSON-based format.
Taken to its logical extreme, this can be seen as another step in the JSON-stack re-inventing tools from the XML-stack. In this regards, let's define the concept for JSON clearly.

== Background
=== Graphics Library Transmission Format (glTF)
The __glTF__ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF[Graphics Library Transmission Format] or GL Transmission Format and formerly known as WebGL Transmissions Format or WebGL TF) is a file format for three-dimensional scenes and models.
GlTF https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF#Extensions[extensions] are in wide-spread use.
The mechanism is document in the https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#specifying-extensions[spec], published by the Khronos Group.

TIP: The glTF extension mechanism was the main inspiration for JSON namespaces.

=== XML
The XML structual model (https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/[_XML Information Set]) consists of _elements_ and _attributes_ footnote:[Ignoring for now the _processing instruction_, _comment_, _entity reference_, _document type declaration_ elements].

XML element::
Can contain a list of sub-elements or text (or even a mix of both).

XML attribute::
Each _XML element_ can have a map of named keys to String values. No nesting is allowed in XML attributes.


==== Namespaces in XML
.References

- https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/[W3C Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)] W3C Recommendation 8 December 2009
- https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/[Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)] W3C Recommendation 16 August 2006

NOTE: XML 1.1 basically only allows more Unicode characters in element names and attribute names.

Why?
A central idea in XML was the notion of mixing several XML-based documents together, in the sense that one document could contains data, specified for another schema.
XML uses XML Schema footnote:[This seems to be the current main-stream schema language. Several other schema languages have also been proposed. Previously _Document Type Definitons_ (DTD) had been used.] to define the structure of an XML document. In this regard, JSON Schema plays a similar role in the JSON ecosystem.
Back to XML.

.How
An XML document looks, as an example footnote:[The example does not show useful XML usage, but syntax elements.], like this:

[source,xml]
----
<adress>
  <country>Germany</country>
  <city capital="yes">Berlin</city>
</address>
----

We assume we have the element `address`, `country` and `city` defined in our schema.

To have unique element names in XML, an XML element can be given a long, unique name.
These unique names are based on the Internat domain name system, which establishes a working mechanism to buy pieces of a namespace (domains). When a domain becomes part of an identifier, the assignment of namespace roots is a solved problem. A domain owner can use any URL on its domain as the namespace for an XML element.
So my "city" element could be extended to by my "https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/city" element.
In XML, this would look ugly:

[source,xml]
----
<https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/adress>
  <https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/country>Germany</https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/country>
  <https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/city>Berlin</https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/city>
</https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/address>
----

So XML uses the usual method of stating a prefix-mapping in the file. The real XML thus looks like this:


[source,xml]
----
<?xml xmlns="https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/">
<adress>
  <country>Germany</country>
  <city>Spandau</city>
</address>
----

This assigns the _default namespace_ for all namespaces not defining an explicit namespace to
`https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/`.

Now lets add the city element from a different schema.

[source,xml]
----
<?xml
  xmlns="https://xam.de/ns/2024/geo/v17/" <1>
  xmlns:destatis="https://example.com/foo#" <2>
  xmlns:og="http://ogp.me/ns#"> <2>
<adress>
  <country>Germany</country>
  <city>Spandau</city>
  <destatis:city>Berlin-Spandau</destatis:city>
</address>
----
<1> The root/default namespace
<2> Additional namespace prefix mappings

NOTE: XML Namespaces were not part of the initial XML proposal.
It was added later at the cost of re-purposing the attribute name `xmlns` (defining namespace mappings) and using colons (`:`) in attribute names (using namespace mappings).

=== JSON
.References
- https://www.json.org/json-en.html[JSON.org]


JSON has a refreshingly simple structural model, with three element types:

JSON object::
An object is an unordered map of named keys to other elements.

JSON array::
An array is a list (encodes order) of other elements.

JSON primitive::
As primitives, JSON provides _String_, _Number_, _Boolean_, _Null_.


== Proposal: JSON Namespaces
[NOTE]
.Comparing XML and JSON
--
A JSON object resembles an XML element, as it allows nesting.
On the other hand, XML attributes allow map-like key-values.
A JSON array can only be compared to an XML element, as no other XML element allows nesting.
--

.Idea
In JSON, we find named keys in the JSON object.
Conceptually, we propose to use unique URIs as JSON object keys.
To keep JSON readable, we propose to define and use namespace mappings.

=== Defining JSON Namespaces
.Specification
****
- Namespaces are defined by using a key name of `{underscore}namespaces` on any JSON object.
- The value of such a __namespace declaration object__ is a JSON object.
- The __namespace declaration object__ uses __namespace prefixes__ as keys and __namespace expansions__ as the value (datatype: String).
- The __default namespace__ is stated via the reserved key `{underscore}` (a single underscore).

- Multiple __namespace declaration object__ are allowed per JSON document.
- Later definitions overwrite earlier definitions.
- No __namespace declaration object__ is required.
- In each __namespace declaration object__, a default namespace is not required.
****

.Good Practice
- It is good practice to use just one definition, near the top of the data.
- It is good practive to use URIs as part of namespace expansions to re-use the existing domain name system for assigning namespace strings to people and organisations.
- It is good practive to use resolvable URIs, so that the resolved URI provides more human-readable information.
- If resolvable URIs are used, the namespace expansion URI should resolve to a JSON schema, defining the structure of elements. #TODO Check how well this works with current JSON Schema#.

.Example: Define a JSON Namespace
[source,json]
----
{
	"_namespaces": {
		"_": "http://example.com/ns/", <1>
		"destatis": "https://example.com/foo#", <2>
		"og": "http://ogp.me/ns#" <3>
	}
}
----
<1> Define the root/default namespace
<2> An example namespace for the "destatis" prefix
<3> The Facebook Open Graph namespace, mapped to prefix `og`


=== Adding JSON Namespaces to JSON Data
.Specification
****
Namespace prefix usage:: The syntax is __(Namespace Prefix)__ `{underscore}` __(Namespace Suffix)__
Expanded form:: It resolves to __(Namespace Expansion)__ __(Namespace Suffix)__.

- Namespace prefixes can be used on the key name in any JSON object.
- Only one namespace prefix can be added to a single key.
- The key `{underscore}` on its own does not map to anything, espacially not the the default namespace.
****

.Example: Use a JSON Namespace
[source,json]
----
"address": {
	"country": "Berlin", <1>
	"city": "Berlin", <1>
	"destatis_city": "Berlin-Spandau" <2>
}
----
<1> In the default namespace
<2> In the _destatis_ namespace

.Full Example
[source,json]
----
{
	"_namespaces": {
		"_": "http://example.com/ns/",
		"destatis": "https://example.com/foo#",
		"og": "http://ogp.me/ns#"
	},
	"addresses": [
		{
			"country": "Berlin",
			"city": "Berlin",
			"destatis_city": "Berlin-Spandau"
		}
	]
}
----


=== Processing JSON with Namespaces
.Interpretation as standard JSON
- Namespace declarations can be stripped before normal processing.
- Namespace prefixes can be resoved to full names. The involves replacing

.Full Example in Expanded Form
[source,json]
----
{
	"addresses": [
		{
			"country": "Berlin",
			"city": "Berlin",
			"https://example.com/foo#city": "Berlin-Spandau"
		}
	]
}
----
Namespace declaration object has been stripped.

NOTE: Expanded form is optional. It is only required, when merging data from different systems, using the same namespace prefixes with different namespace expansions.



== Working with JSON Namespaces

=== Merging
Two arbitrary JSON objects can be merged, by coyping the key-value pairs from one (source) object to another (target) object.


=== Validation
#TODO Describe how to use JSON Schema to allow extensions.#
